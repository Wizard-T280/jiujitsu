  <h3 class="text-2xl mb-2">Adult JiuJitsu Fundamentals Program</h3>
  <p>13yrs and up, All Levels</p>
  <p>#175 per month, unlimited training</p>
  <p>The 1st 12 months of classes will be a Fundamentals Curriculum focusing on the basics of JiuJitsu, Wrestling and Self Defense. This is a 12 month cyclical program for beginners but all ranks are welcome to attend. 
After attending 12 months of the Fundamentals, students will then be able to comprehend the basic movements of JiuJitsu, have a concept for dealing with an opponent throwing strikes and progress to more advanced classes. 
While the sport of JiuJitsu has skyrocketed, many schools have lost the combative self defense aspect that is the foundation of JiuJitsu. At BQuick Jiu Jitsu the focus is always to survive and dominate an altercation. As a combat Army veteran of the invading year of Iraq 2003-2004 this is highly important to Coach Quick. Competition does test one’s ability in a safe and controlled environment and creates many life long positive health habits and experiences though!
Coach Brandon Quick is the co-owner of the American Grappling Federation which conducts 100+ U.S. and European JiuJitsu tournaments per year.
He owned and taught at 5 MMA and Jiu Jitsu schools in Dallas Ft Worth, Texas before relocating to Florida in 2020. Brandon has 25 black belts and schools affiliated with him across the U.S., Belgium, Trinidad & Tobago and Portugal. 4 of those black belts went thru all of the kids ranks and adult ranks of jiujitsu with Mr Quick with 2 going on to fight MMA and the other 2 wrestled collegiately. 4 UFC veterans and 20+ pro MMA fighters are in the BQuick Jiu Jitsu Network! 
Take advantage of the opportunity to train in an elite program for all ages by the most experienced instructor in MMA the area!</p>
